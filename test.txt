The bird sings in the forest. The bird sings by the creek. The water flows in the forest. The water flows by the creek. The bird sings. The creek flows. The forest echoes the song. The creek echoes the song. The bird in the forest, the water by the creek. Repeatedly, the song fills the air, and the echoes blend with the creek. The forest, the creek, the bird, the song, the echoes, and the water; all blend harmoniously.
